Week -3: 27thAug to 10Sep:
	Preprocessing:
		Trim Images Top and Bottom.
		Change the class count to 1 from 8. (Dumb Mistake)
	Try out 4 new models:
		   and another 1..
		
	Meghana:
		Preprocessing:
			Trim Images Top and Bottom.
			Change the class count to 1 from 8. (Dumb Mistake)
		ResNet50V2
	Surangana:
		Preprocessing:
			Trim Images Top and Bottom.
			Change the class count to 1 from 8. (Dumb Mistake)
		MobileNetv2
	Samarth:
		ResNet101V2 and one more.. 
		System to track uploads:
			Data used, Model used, model settings, attained ROCAUC score(after upload)..
		
	Weekend.. Saturday..
		Get predictions into csv and upload..
		
	
Week -2: 10Sep to 17Sep:

	Take the best model we have.
	Predict the unlabelled data, having probability > 90% (or 95).
	Consider the predictions as labels:
		When labelled, compare the Ratio of error between:
			Original Training set.
			Assigned labels on Unlabelled set.
		
	Then Retrain more..
	Compare the accuracy before and after Unlabelled data train.
	Setup DVC Pipeline for tracking Models.
	
	Hyperparameters Exp:
		Threshold or probability for labelling unlabelled data.
		Amount of unlabelled data to be fed.
	Monitoring:
		Difference in accuracy.
		
Week -1: 17Sep to 24Sep (DDay):
	
	Testing out different approaches and buffer..
